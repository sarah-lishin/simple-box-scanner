A simple script to automate nmap, nikto, dirb, wpscan, and enum4linux scans.

# About:
Written by fiolet. 
A simple tool to run nmap with cve, nikto, dirb with common wordlist, wpscan, and enum4linux with a single command.
All will run, even if no open ports are detected.
Files will save to the current working directory.
Enjoy.

# Usage:
Run from the command line: ./simple-box-scanner <IP> <Box Name>

(I recommend adding an alias to your ~./bashrc file)
