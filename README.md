# simple-box-scanner
A simple script to automate nmap and nikto scans.

# About:
Written by fiolet. 
A simple tool to run nmap with cve and nikto with a single command.
Both will run, even if no open ports are detected.
Files will save to the current working directory.
Enjoy.

# Usage:
Run from the command line: ./simple-box-scanner <IP> <Box Name>

(I recommend adding an alias to your ~./bashrc file)
